# Content

The courses offer a small introductory lesson after which it provides a set of further reading. For every level, there is an introductory lesson followed by a set of lessons marked as 'essentials'. These lessons contain content that is recommended reading at this level. Other than 'essentials', there is course content further classified into categories. These categories are optional. You can take these lessons if you are interested in that particular category.

The course content will rarely center around a particular framework or technology. It will introduce a few of them with a few points that may help you make a choice.
