So, you want to venture into software engineering. *ramen* will walk you through the first few steps to becoming a software engineer and hopefully and effective one.

I have had questions of my own when I started. I wanted to know how to start. What to learn and what not to. There is a plethora of information available online. What is essential? What is not? How do I extract the signal from noise?

I was fortunate enough to have people who were willing to take me into their tutelage. They showed me a path and pointed me in directions that helped me learn a lot of things in a very short amount of time. Everyone can't have access to the kind of mentors I did.

People often ask me how to begin. I can sense the same trepidation I had at the time. This course is a response to those questions. *ramen* would guide you through the information maze that is the internet and cherry-pick stuff that I deem important knowledge to a software engineer.
