# Command line familiarity

I could go on about the merits of using the command line. I will keep it short. It is indispensable. Mastering the commandline can get you *legendary* debugging and automation skills.

## Now what?

I will outline a set of tasks. These are common enough that you'd require to do them every few days. Google around and figure out how to do these. While I could have put in links here, it is helpful if you figure out what terms can lead you to results faster. Trust me.

1. Installing software using the command line. Use the package manager for your OS. Search for and install a program called `gtypist`.
1. Editing files on the command line. Install GNU nano. Use it to open files and edit them. `nano ~/foo.txt` should let you open a file called foo.txt in your home directory.
1. Navigate directories (folders) using the command line. [This](http://www.westwind.com/reference/os-x/commandline/navigation.html) seemed helpful.
