# Command line familiarity

As an engineer, while programming, or while debugging something sinister on your execution environment, you will need to be able to execute commands on the command line. It is an indispensable skill. Servers or other target environments rarely have a GUI accessible. The only way to interact with such an environment is via the command line. In some cases, while a GUI may be accessible, scrolling turns out to be an aimless exercise. The command line can be an amazing assistant.

# Getting a command line interface

I will be focussing on the three primary operating systems here.

## Linux / Mac OS X

Linux or similar operating systems like BSD or solaris can be really helpful when learning the command line. A lot of tools are built by developers working on these operating systems. The philosophy of writing small tools that do one task and one task only is pervasive in these operating systems.

## Windows

TBD.

# Further Ideas
- talk about shell, kernel
- why install linux or a *nix like system
