# Starting out: getting your gear

As engineers, you have to figure out efficient ways to make a system behave the way you want it to. The operative word there is _efficient_. One of the ways to efficiently and effectively interact with your computer is to talk to it in text. Not gestures, but text. There is only a single way to interpret text and if you use the correct tools, you can get your job done fast. Blazing fast.

To interact with your computer in text, you need to use the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). Now a command line by itself is not much. You need tools that are available on the command line. Operating systems that use the Linux kernel, popularly known as linux distros have a command line interface and thousands of easily installable tools that help you build your command line arsenal.

The necessity of familiarity with command line tools is such that I'd recommend (No! Require!) you to install a linux distribution on your computer before we even start. It is possible for linux to live alongside your regular operating system. I recommend [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) as it has been touted and used as an introduction to Linux OSes for years. Any problem you have with installation will probably have occurred to somebody else and you would be able to find a solution to it online.

Note: If you have an OS X based system, you are good to go.
